This repository is based on [albinotonnina/albinotonnina.com](https://github.com/albinotonnina/albinotonnina.com) personal website.
In fact, it is one of the **best** personal websites that inspired me.
You can check his unique colorful One Page portfolio that animates as you scroll down and create your own.
You can check this [repo](https://github.com/emmabostian/developer-portfolios) :octocat: too for more personal portfolio ideas.

## Install
`yarn`

## Dev
`yarn dev`

## Build
`yarn build`

## Test
`yarn test`

It uses [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for testing. 
## Customization

It is a node project developed using [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/guides/getting-started/) module bundler. For any customization, you will need any SVG editor tool
like [Clker](http://www.clker.com/inc/svgedit/svg-editor.html) or [Boxy SVG](https://boxy-svg.com/app) for your personal scenes. You can use Adobe Illustrator
otherwise then convert them to SVG :unamused:. 
It is mainly structured into 6 scenes where each of them describe a subject:
introduction, work, skills and contact info. You can eventually add as many scenes as you want according to your needs and import them in
the `getScenes.js` file.
